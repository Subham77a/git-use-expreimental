as we have already come the commit through "git commit -m "first commit" now the thing i am typing here in another file is another aspect of how the things would be going out 
fluently

also if we do have numberious files in the package rather than adding them 
one by one what we can do is we can simply use "git add ." 
to add all the files in the curent directory 
 and also we can check all of it  

 so here we can check the status through "git status" and the details about the 
 commits from "git log"
 now we have commited "git commit -m "tutorial w and 3""
 tutorial 2 and 3 is the name of the git commit .
